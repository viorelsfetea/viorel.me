Born and raised in Romania, I grew up wanting to be a journalist. I somehow ended up studying PR and Communication, which was great because it made me realize that what I _really_ wanted to do is write software.

### Get to know me better

- I'm working as a Fullstackish Developer. See my [Stak Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/246311) profile for details of what I do. Or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/viorelsfetea), if that's your cup of tea.
- I try to give back to Open Source as much as I can. Checkout out the projects on my [Github](https://github.com/viorelsfetea) profile.
- I like reading, sometimes fiction, sometimes technical books. Mostly fiction. My reading list is public on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38870369-viorel-sfetea).
- I sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/viorel_sfetea).
